###################### INSTALL system prerequisites #####################

# The main purpose of this script is to install all system prerequisites in
# in one go, so that:
# - repeated questions for the sudo password are avoided
# - there are no conflicts between required system packages

# On MacPorts one needs to install gtk3 separately upfront to ensure no X11 (but quartz) dependencies are installed
